<!-- The output signals from an rx or tx to the subdevice for multiplexing
     The subdevice reset is the control reset, so that signal doesn't need to be here
     These are the signals that either rx or tx would generate, when either only one of them
     is present, or they are both present.

     Signals specific to rx or tx are directly connected from those device workers and not here.
     The ENABLE and TXNRX signals are independent in FDD mode, but in TDD mode
     The ENABLE is common, and TXNRX indicates whether TX or RX is enabled.
     So in TDD mode, when both rx and tx are present, the subdevice handles the issue,
     with enable coming from both rx and tx, but TXNRX driven by the subdevice.
     This is all only relevant with the switching is *not* done using SPI registers in any case.

     This file lives here in ad9361_rx.hdl because it needs to be shared with not only the tx,
     but perhaps multiple subdevice implementations.
