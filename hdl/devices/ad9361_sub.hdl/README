This device worker is a submodule shared by the ad9361 rx and tx workers.
It is required when one or both of the rx and tx workers are instanced.

It serves three purposes:

1. To drive the common reset (from either control reset in rawprops ports)
2. To share the single SPI interface for raw property acccess
3. To mux the enable and sync_in signals from rx and/or tx to create the single SYNC_IN
   signal, and to drive the proper ENABLE (rx) and TXNRX (tx) signals.
