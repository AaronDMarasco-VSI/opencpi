<!-- A shared SPI between TX and RX devices
     that handles raw properties and reset from one or both.
     The property data path is 32 bits since that is what is present
     in both TX and RX device workers, and although we are selecting
     from two 32 bit paths, we are only byte-selecting in one place,
     which removes logic from both TX and RX -->
