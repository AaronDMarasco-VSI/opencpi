<!-- Definition of the lime HSMC dev kit card: EVB6002-6
     1. Which devices workers are used.
     2. How they are wired to the slot connector(s)
     3. Which devices workers are required by which other device workers
     4. How these dependent device workers are wired what they depend on. -->
