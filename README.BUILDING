This branch of OpenCPI is designed to be RPM-based for CentOS 6 and 7.

RPMs are available in a yum repo at http://opencpi.github.io/repo/

To build the RPMs:
  cd releng
  make prereq-host
  make cdk

Type just "make" in releng for more options, e.g. building the RPMs for Zynq-based platforms.

Consult the "RPM Installation Guide" for more information.
