In order to manually build the latex documentation in this folder, various dependencies are required to be installed.

Run:
$ sudo yum install -y texlive-latex rubber
For CentOS 7, the packages needed are:
$ sudo yum install -y texlive-latex-bin texlive-texconfig-bin texlive-metafont-bin texlive-cm texlive-pdftex-def texlive-ifluatex texlive-zapfding texlive-helvetic texlive-times texlive-symbol texlive-titlesec texlive-multirow texlive-dvips texlive-fancyhdr texlive-collection-fontsrecommended texlive-microtype texlive-rotating texlive-placeins texlive-appendix
If you have strange problems, you MIGHT have to do:
$ sudo rm -rf /var/lib/texmf/

Non-RPM packages:
PLEASE try to keep this list minimal. To see if an RPM package for your .sty file exists, use
repoquery --whatprovides "*/yourfile.sty"

If it is available as a full installer package, add it to the first list.
If it is ONLY a single .sty file with no installer, add it to the second list.

To install required packages:
==SCR==
cd ~
set -e
mkdir -p texmf
TDS="datatool glossaries mfirstuc xfor"
STY="substr"
for tds in ${TDS}; do
  wget -nv http://mirrors.ctan.org/install/macros/latex/contrib/${tds}.tds.zip
  unzip -q ${tds}.tds.zip -d texmf
  rm ${tds}.tds.zip
done
for sty in ${STY} ; do
  wget -nv http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/${sty}/${sty}.sty
  mkdir -p texmf/tex/latex/${sty}
  mv ${sty}.sty texmf/tex/latex/${sty}
done
texhash ~/texmf
for chk in ${TDS} ${STY}; do
  kpsewhich ${chk}.sty || echo "${chk} could not be found"
done
==SCR==

You should probably add any directories under ~/texmf/scripts to your PATH variable.

To build a PDF from sources, run:
$ rubber --pdf <filename>.tex

To spell check your edits, run:
aspell list < filename.tex | sort | uniq -c | less
(You might want to save this off and do a before/after comparison to only see what you added.)

Notes:
Please only add to the "sudo yum" files and do not modify the prefix; those lines are parsed by a script elsewhere.
Same for the SCR flags.
If you change them in any way, please contact the Jenkins administrator so the Docker container can be updated.
