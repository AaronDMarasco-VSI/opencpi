The documents at the top level of this directory are current and relevant for users.
The "internal" directory contains specifications and documents about the internals of OpenCPI.
The "old" directory contains documents that are no longer current, but are available for historical reasons.

Near term documentation plans (GFY15):

The "Generic Authoring Model" content will be absorbed into the "Component Development" doc.
The "RCC Reference" content will be absorbed into the "Component Development" doc.
The C++ Language variant of the RCC model will be documented in the "Component Development" doc.
A new Platform Development doc will be introduced.
A "Introduction/Technical Summary" document will be added.

Thus the key doc set will be:
1. Introduction
2. Installation/Getting Started
3. Application Development
4. Component Development
5. Platform Development
