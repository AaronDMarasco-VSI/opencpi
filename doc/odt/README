This directory contains OpenOffice/LibreOffice documents for OpenCPI.
They all use the template here named shared/OCPI_ODT.ott, which must be imported
into LibreOffice before editing any of these odt documents.

After editing a document, the Export PDF function under the file menu should be used
to place the PDF in the ../pdf directory, and that PDF file should be part of the commit.
Set "pages and bookmarks" as the initial view.

Also, export as html in ../html using the Writer2xhtml extension.
Use HTML5 export, and select "put images in a subdirectory".

Similarly, if the template is edited, it should be re-exported into the shared directory.

If any editing of these ODT documents is done, the template should be imported
first.

Look at the "diagrams.txt" file if you are adding or editing diagrams in these
documents. They are currently edited in powerpoint, and not yet included in the repo.
