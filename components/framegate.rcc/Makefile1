# A component library, consisting of different models built for different targets
# The expectation is that a library has spec XML in the top level, and subdirectories for each implementation.
# Active implementations are lists in Implementations.
# This this makefile just names the library and lists implementations to be built.
# The name of an implementation includes its authoring model as the file extension.
# This specification of model is redundant with the "include" line in the makefile inside the directory
# We also list the targets per model.
