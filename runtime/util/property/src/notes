So wip needs granularity and value size
a member has both.
a structure also has both
a sequence of structures has both
a sequence of arguments has both.
a protocol may have a value size greater than the datawidth, which just means
the datavalue width is the minimium of the datavalue and the datawidth, and then, e.g. for
64 bit quantities in a 16 bit data path the granularity is 4.
probably need a sort of "parent accumulator" struct so members can accumulate in structs,
and properties can accumulate in payloads or a property sheet,  with the primary difference being that
arguments are not random access (unless we want to put an offset table in our payloads).

maxalign cum
min datum cum
granularity cum
offset cum

2 levels: member to struct, arg to message (or prop to app props).

maxalign is global for property sheets and message buffers
but needed for middle level.
