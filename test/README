CPI TEST SUITE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the test suite for CPI.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Running the entire test suite
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The entire test suite is run using:

  make -f Makefile.cpi test

A new directory "log-<timestamp>" is created.  Each test is run; its
standard output and standard error are redirected to a log file.  If
a test completes successfully, its log file is removed so that only
the log files of skipped or failed tests remain.

Eventually, a test report is written to the "run-all-tests.log" file.

Note that the test suite must be built separately before it is run.
(This is not implicit, because in the case of cross-compilation, the
test suite must be built on the development host and is later run on
the target.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Running a single test
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To run a single test, use:

  make -f Makefile.cpi test TESTS="<test>"

Where <test> is the file that implements the test.

In this case, the test output is not redirected to a file.  A single
status line is printed at the end indicating whether the test has
passed, failed or was skipped.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Running a set of tests
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To run a set of tests, use

  make -f Makefile.cpi test TESTS="<test1> <test2> ..."

Where <test1> etc. are the files that implement the tests.

Like when running the entire test suite, a new directory is created
to contain the test logs and the overall test report.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Implementing a test
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Any executable file in the directory hiearchy under the "test"
directory whose name begins with "test" is considered a test.  Adding
to the test suite involves writing a new script or executable, naming
it "test*", and placing it within this directory hierarchy.

A test's status is communicated using its return code:

- If the test returns 0, it succeeded.
- If the test returns 2, it was skipped.
- If the test returns any other code, it failed.

A test should return 2 if the test can not be performed in the current
configuration.  (The rationale for using "2" for skipped instead of 1
is that most shell commands fail with a return code of 1, so it seemed
to make sense to stick to the convention that "1" means failed.)

All settings from MakeVars.cpi are exported as environment variables
before the test is run, so the test can use these variables. E.g.,
tests should use the $CPIDIR and $OUTDIR variables to locate any
executables and can use $SYSTEM to decide whether they can run or
not.

Tests shall not require user interaction and shall not hang.

Tests may assume that the current working directory is set to the
directory that contains the test.

To avoid side effects, a test should clean up after itself and remove
all processes and files that it created.

Tests that require compiled code have two options:

- Tie into the CPI build system by providing a Makefile.cpi file two
  directory levels below the test directory.
- Provide its own Makefile (without the .cpi extension).

At compile time (or whenever doing a "make -f Makefile.cpi build" in
the test directory), all of these makefiles are executed.

To support cross-compilation, it is highly recommended that makefiles
take advantage of the $(OUTDIR) variable from MakeVars.cpi to place
compiled files into a target-specific subdirectory.

All makefiles shall also provide a "clean" target.
