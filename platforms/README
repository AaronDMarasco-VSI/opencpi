This directory is for OpenCPI runtime platforms, whether development-capable
platforms or embedded platforms.  The name of each subdirectory is a unique name
for the platform.  The contents of each directory is a set of platform specific
files and scripts, and is thus a home for platform specific "stuff".

There are a few standard files that are expected to be in *each platform subdirectory*:

README:                  describes the platform
target:                  a one line text file containing the compilation target for the platform.
                         E.g. for centos6: linux-c6-x86_64.
<platform>-env.sh:       the default OpenCPI environment settings for the platform.
<platform>-packages.sh:  a script to download and install packages from the
                         standard repository for the OS.
<platform>-target.mk:    settings for Makefiles for this platform
<platform>-target.sh:    settings for shell scripts for this platform

The other contents of this platforms directory are:

getPlatform.sh: a script to determine what platform we are running on, which should
                be enhanced when new platforms are added.

Thus adding a platform requires at least:

1. Adding a directory here with the files mentioned above.
2. Enhancing the getPlatform.sh script to recognize when running on the new platform
3. Ensuring that there is compilation (or cross-compilation) support for the target.
4. Add the "target" and "<platform>-env.sh" scripts to the new directory.
5. Once getPlatform.sh works on the new platform (and doesn't break on other platforms),
   the following scripts should execute (at the top level):
     ./scripts/install-prerequisites.sh
     ./scripts/build-opencpi.sh
     ./scripts/test-opencpi.sh
