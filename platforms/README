This directory is for OpenCPI runtime platforms, whether development-capable
platforms or embedded platforms.  The name of each subdirectory is a unique name
for the platform.  The contents of each directory is a set of platform specific
files and scripts, and is thus a home for platform specific "stuff".

There are a few standard files that are expected to be in each platform subdirectory:

README: describes the platform
target: contains the compilation target for the platform.  E.g. for centos6: linux-c6-x86_64.
<platform>-env.sh: contains the default OpenCPI environment settings for the platform.

The other contents of this platforms directory are:

getPlatform.sh: a script to determine what platform we are running on, which should
                be enhanced when new platforms are added.

Thus adding a platform requires at least:
1. Adding a directory here with the files mentioned above.
2. Enhancing the getPlatform.sh script to recognize when running on the new platform
3. Ensuring that there is compilation (or cross-compilation) support for the target.
