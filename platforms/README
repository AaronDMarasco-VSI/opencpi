This directory is for OpenCPI runtime platforms - systems that are not
generic linux development systems, but just (typically embedded)
runtime systems on which to execute various opencpi software
applications (such as ocpirun and ocpihdl).  The software (and FPGA
bitstreams) for such systems are usually built using cross-tools on a
generic linux development system with the appropriate tools installed.

Each platform should have a README about how to set it up, and any other
scripts or files to enable the platform.
