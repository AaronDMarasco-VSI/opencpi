This is a copy/clone of the nice astyle program from sourceforge.net
It uses the LGPL license the same as OpenCPI.
We patched it to fix some case statement formatting issues.
The files that were patched have a ".orig" suffixed copy (in src/).
We'll submit the patches to the astyle list "soon".
The default format for OpenCPI, which is also the emacs default with 
"attached" braces, is to use (with this patched version):

astyle -A2 -T2 -xT8 -H -c -xL -n -N

This means we can always use the emacs formatter when editing code there,
(c-m-Q) and that is the repo format.
