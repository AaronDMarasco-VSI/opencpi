This project is used by the unit tests in utilization_test.py.

The purpose of this project is to contain static log files for
utilization reporting so that the get/show_utilization() python
functions can be tested for correctness.

The project contains a worker, three hdl platforms, and an assembly,
each of which has the directory structure that makes it appear as a
built OpenCPI asset. In reality the only real 'built' files are
the tool log files for synthesis and implementation. So, even
though there are no netlists or bitstreams, show/get_utilization()
functions can be run on these assets from python to see HDL
utilization tables for them.

In order to avoid removal of these log files on a clean, all target-*
directories have been made read-only. This also avoids overwriting of
these files if a user tries to rebuild this project.

Initially, these assets have been built for the following targets with
the following tool versions:
virtex6  : Xilinx ISE 14.7
zynq     : Xilinx Vivado 2017.1
stratix4 : Intel Quartus Prime Standard Edition 17.1

In order to test different tool versions, there are two options:
1. Duplicate this project
   - change the README to list different tool versions in the table above
   - choose a name for the new project (this name might mention the tool versions)
   - change the target-* directories to writable in the new copy
   - build the project using whichever tool versions are desired
   - only add the necessary log files to the git repo
   - update the utilization_test.py to test this project as well
2. Duplicate each worker/platform/assembly
   - names might have tool-versions in them (e.g. util_wkr_viv19_1_quartus19_1.hdl)
   - change the target-* directories to writable in the new copy
   - build each new asset using whichever tool versions are desired
   - only add the necessary log files to the git repo
   - update the utilization_test.py to test these assets as well
