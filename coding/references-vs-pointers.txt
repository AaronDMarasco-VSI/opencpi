References provide better compiler error checking since conversions are not possible.
If there is no sentinel value expected or checked (e.g. NULL), leave it a reference.
There are fewer characters in the source code using references.
(Scott Meyers has this preference too).

The same applies to return values.  Unless NULL is meaningful, return a reference.

Yes, there is a downside that the code does not explicitly show indirection,
and sometimes constructors are more complex.
