Error and help messages from tools and scripts.

Use double quotes in all user oriented error and help messages.
Single quotes are ok for contractions, but otherwise don't use single quotes for quoting.
Quote any user defined names or invalid options in messages (in double quotes) to make clear
that it is a variable string and not part of the language of the message.

Wrap help messages at the same point as source code:  97 characters per line.

Error messages can be longer and will simply wrap in the window.
