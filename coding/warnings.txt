Unused argument warnings in C++ should be addressed by using /* */ commands around the
argument names rather then inserting the C-style "(void)arg" syntax.
Warnings that suggest extra parentheses for && vs. || are not accomodated,
but are suppressed when we can.
Warnings that suggest extra braces for if and else are similar not accomodated.
