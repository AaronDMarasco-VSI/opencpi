Headers should be included in the order of basic dependency layers,
with the botton layers first.

Headers outside opencpi should use <>, while headers inside opencpi
shoud use "".

"distant" headers are included first since we don't want to collide
with anything in headers we don't control.

A typical ordering is:

1. C langauge headers if there are any. (from the C standard library) e.g. stdint.h
2. POSIX C headers (from the POSIX standard)
3. OS headers (linux-specific etc.) when we use them.
4. C++ language headers if there are any.
5. External library dependency headers (if any)

The above headers should be in angle brackets since they are not in opencpi.

One wierd case is the formatting macros like PRIu64, found in <inttypes.h>.
The ISO C99 spec says the are only included from inttypes.h if __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
is defined.  So if you use these, you must put this as *the first header*:
#define __STD_FORMAT_MACROS
#include <inttypes.h>

After the above headers are those from OpenCPI, also in the order of
"lower" or "more distant" first, enclosed in double quotes, not angle brackets,
typically ordered:

6. OcpiOS headers (OS abstraction)
7. OcpiUtil headers (general utilities)
8. Other layers below the current code
9. Headers for the current code classes etc.

Our headers start with typical
#ifdef UPPERCASEDFILENAME_H
#define UPPERCASEDFILENAME_H

<copywrite/license in comments>

<header files included ordered per above>

<namespace scoping open>

<real content here>

<namespace scoping closing>
#endif


It is a good idea to periodically prune include files by commenting
them all out, and then including those that are needed.  If a file
gets a significant update, do this.  But generally, headers should be
included for all specifically referenced items and no more.
