These scripts are those that are run at the top level of the opencpi source tree that are not
part of the CDK.  They are generally used for installing software or initializing the environment
when building the core software.

I.e. scripts that are never exported in the CDK and thus not needed by users
(only core OpenCPI maintainers) are also here.

The particular script install-prerequisites.sh installs all the external packages opencpi
depends on, including those installed by "sudo yum install", and also those that require running
the specific scripts here (e.g. scripts/install-gmp.sh) that download, configure, patch, build,
and install (in /opt/prerequisites).

Some installation scripts here are optional, and not invoked by install-prerequisites.
