These scripts are those that are run at the top level of the opencpi source tree that are not
part of the CDK.  They are generally used for installing software or initializing the environment
when building the core software.

I.e. scripts that are never exported in the CDK and thus not needed by users
(only core OpenCPI maintainers) are also here.

The particular script install-prerequisites.sh installs all the external packages opencpi
depends on, including those installed by "sudo yum install", and also those that require running
the specific scripts here (e.g. scripts/install-gmp.sh) that download, configure, patch, build,
and install (in /opt/opencpi/prerequisites).

When ./scripts/install_prerequisites.sh is called with no arguments, it installs packages for
host platform you are running on.  If you want installations for multiple development platforms
(e.g. centos6 and centos7), you need to run the script in each environment.
To make installations for cross-built (usually embedded) platforms, you can provide the name of
the platform as an argument to the script (or set OCPI_TARGET_PLATFORM in your environment).

Some installation scripts here are optional, and not invoked by install-prerequisites.sh.
