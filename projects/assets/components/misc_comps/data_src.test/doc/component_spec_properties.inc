Name                 & Type   & SequenceLength & ArrayDimensions & Accessibility       & Valid Range & Default & Description
\\
\hline
DATA\_BIT\_WIDTH\_p & ushort & - & - &  & Standard & 16 & Determines the width of the buses for each of the I and Q data generation memory elements - if less than 16, the most significant DATA\_BIT\_WIDTH\_p bits of I and Q on the out port will be filled. Value is expect to be less than or equal to 16.\\
\hline
LFSR\_POLYNOMIAL\_p & bool & - & - &  & Standard & 0 & E.g., a value of 1,1,0,1 would correspond to an LFSR polynomial of x\^{}4 + x\^{}3 + (0*x\^{}2) + x\^{}1 + 1 (+1 is always implied regardless of value).\\
\hline
LFSR\_SEED\_p & bool & - & - &  & Standard & 0 & Out-of-reset value of the Linear Feedback Shift Register (only affects output data in LFSR mode). This value should never be all zeros, which would cause the register to always have a value of all zeros regardless of polynomial value.\\
\hline
ZLM\_WHEN\_NUM\_SAMPLES\_REACHED\_p & bool & - & - &  & Standard & false & When value is true and num\_samples property value is not -1, worker will generate Zero-Length-Message after num\_samples amount of samples have been sent out the output port. Note this functionality is independent of the value of the enable property.\\
\hline
messageSize\_bytes & ulong & - & - & Readable, Initial & Standard & 0 & Message size in bytes. When the value of (num\_samples * num bytes per sample) is less than this property's value, the value of (num\_samples * num bytes per sample) is used as the message size.\\
\hline
num\_samples & long & - & - & Readable, Writable & Standard & -1 & Maximum number of samples which will be sent out of the output port once out of reset. Note that samples are only sent when the enable property has a value of true. When the value of this property is -1, samples will be sent indefinitely (obeying backpressure from the connected worker, of course).\\
\hline
fixed\_value & bool & - & - & Readable, Writable & Standard & 0x5a5a & The value of this property will be used for I (and the bit-reversed version of this value will be used for Q) to send to the output port when the mode property's value is 'fixed'.                                             Array index 0 corresponds to the 15th (most significant) I bit and the 16-DATA\_BIT\_WIDTH\_p Q bit of the out port,                                             array index 1 corresponds to the 14th (next-to-most significant) I bit and the 15-DATA\_BIT\_WIDTH\_p Q bit of the out port, etc...\\
\hline
mode & enum & - & - & Readable, Writable & count, walking, LFSR, fixed & count & Counter, walking ones, Linear Feedback Shift Register, or fixed value.\\
\hline
enable & bool & - & - & Readable, Writable & Standard & true & When the worker is not in reset, this property must have a value of true for the data to be sent to the output. Note that this property has no effect on the ZLM operation (see ZLM\_WHEN\_NUM\_SAMPLES\_REACHED\_p parameter property).\\
\hline
LFSR\_bit\_reverse & bool & - & - & Readable, Writable & Standard & true & Used to determine the LFSR shift direction. When true, the DATA\_BIT\_WIDTH\_p-bits wide LFSR will be reversed for both I and Q.\\
\hline
mask\_I & ushort & - & - & Readable, Writable & Standard & 0xffff & I data will be bitwise anded with this mask before being sent to out port.\\
\hline
mask\_Q & ushort & - & - & Readable, Writable & Standard & 0xffff & Q data will be bitwise anded with this mask before being sent to out port.\\
