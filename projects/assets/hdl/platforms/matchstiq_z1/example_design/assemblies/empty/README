The purpose of example design is to provide an example of a container which
instances the 'base' platform configuration and all of the device workers 
necessary to support both transmit and receive interfaces of the Lime 
Microsystems transciever device. 

The assembly used by this example is "empty" assembly, i.e. it does 
not have a worker, which results in the ADC and DAC of the Lime being 
connected directly to the Zynq PS (via the OpenCPI data plane DMA engine 
infrastruture).

The container targets the matchstiq_z1 'base' platform configuration.

The container instances and connects the following modules:

 - lime_tx.hdl
 - lime_rx.hdl
 - the subdevice lime_spi.hdl is automatically instanced to support lime_tx and lime_rx
 - lime_adc.hdl
 - lime_dac.hdl
 - si5338.hdl
 - matchstiq_z1_avr.hdl
 - tmp100.hdl
 - pca9534.hdl
 - pca9535.hdl
 - matchstiq_z1_i2c.hdl is automatically instances to support the i2c workers
