This directory (in any project) is for OpenCPI runtime platforms, whether development-capable
platforms or embedded runtime-only platforms.  The name of each subdirectory is a unique name
for the platform.  The contents of each directory is a set of platform-specific files and
scripts making it the home for platform-specific "stuff".

There are a few standard files that are expected to be in each platform subdirectory:

README:                  Describes the platform
<platform>-packages.sh: Script to download and install packages from the standard repositories
                        for the OS
                        (optional, development platforms only)
<platform>-check.sh:    A script to verify you are running on this platform
                        (development platforms only)
<platform>.mk:          Settings for building code targeting this platform
                        See include/platform-defaults.mk for a list of valid variables
                        that can be defined as well as their defaults.
<platform>.exports:     Allows a software platform to "add and subtract" from the standard
                        framework exports. The + and = lines have the same meaning as in
                        Project.exports. See the Platform Development Guide for more details.
                        (optional)

If any platform-specific prerequisites are mentioned in the <platform>.mk file
("OcpiPlatformPrerequisites"), then for each one there should exist a script named
install-<prerequisite>.sh

Therefore, adding a platform requires at least these steps:

1. Add a directory here with the files mentioned above, and a README file describing it.
2. Ensuring that there is compilation (or cross-compilation) support for the target.
   Perhaps creating a tool chain prerequisite installation script here.
3. If needed for a development platform, add a "<platform>-packages.sh" script to the directory.
4. For a development platform add the "<platform>-check.sh" script.
5. Add the "<platform>.mk" files to the directory.
6. Once getPlatform.sh works on the the development platform,
   the following scripts should work (at the top level):
     ./scripts/install-packages.sh <platform>
     ./scripts/install-prerequisites.sh <platform>
     ./scripts/build-opencpi.sh <platform>
     ./scripts/test-opencpi.sh <platform>
   All these scripts take an optional <platform> argument.
   The test-opencpi.sh will not run on cross-platforms.
   The scripts/install-opencpi.sh runs all 4 scripts and also takes a platform argument.
