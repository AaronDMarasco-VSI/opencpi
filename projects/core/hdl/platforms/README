This is a library of HDL platforms. An HDL  "platform" is composed of a 
platform worker, OpenCPI or Vendor IP and possibly device workers
that may be generic or unique and supporting proxies.

The platform worker, is combined with IP, and optional device workers
to create a platform configuration. The platform configuration is 
combined with the assembly, and additionally more device workers, to
construct the container (bitstream).

The following is high-level summary of the steps for creating a new platform:

1. If not already supported, update the framwork to support the new FPGA target family:
This requires changing the hdl-targets.mk to included the new family.  
This may involve updating the tool scripts, e.g. xst.mk or quartus.mk.

2. Make a copy of an existing platform directory as a starting point.
In the platform's directory you must:

i) Define the platform worker in <platform>.xml

ii) Specify the cores used by setting the Cores variable to specify cores found in the
hdl/primitives directory.

iii) Specify the SourceFiles variable to the top level source files that are 
presumably placed in this directory other than the platform worker itself.

iv) Create a <platform>.mk file for use by the final bit-stream-building scripts as needed.
This is needed when tool scripts need to know certain settings for the platform being built.
Examples are the "HdlPromArgs_<platform>" variable that xilinx back end scripts need.

v). Create any other per-platform files, like Xilinx UCF/XCF files.
