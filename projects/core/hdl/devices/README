This is a library of device workers and, when necessary, their supporting proxies.

The specs subdirectory is for when there is a separate spec file 
for a device worker (when more than one implementation exists for 
the same high level interface).

Similar to other OpenCPI libraries, the built workers and proxies are make available
to the framework via the "lib" subdirectory and the contents within.
